# Advanced Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates an advanced Hardhat use case, integrating other tools commonly used alongside Hardhat in the ecosystem.

The project comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts. It also comes with a variety of other tools, preconfigured to work with the project code.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat help
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat coverage
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
node scripts/deploy.js
npx eslint '**/*.js'
npx eslint '**/*.js' --fix
npx prettier '**/*.{json,sol,md}' --check
npx prettier '**/*.{json,sol,md}' --write
npx solhint 'contracts/**/*.sol'
npx solhint 'contracts/**/*.sol' --fix
```

# Etherscan verification

To try out Etherscan verification, you first need to deploy a contract to an Ethereum network that's supported by Etherscan, such as Ropsten.

In this project, copy the .env.example file to a file named .env, and then edit it to fill in the details. Enter your Etherscan API key, your Ropsten node URL (eg from Alchemy), and the private key of the account which will send the deployment transaction. With a valid .env file in place, first deploy your contract:

```shell
hardhat run --network ropsten scripts/deploy.js
```

Then, copy the deployment address and paste it in to replace `DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in this command:

```shell
npx hardhat verify --network ropsten DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "Hello, Hardhat!"
```
# General Guiudelines

This project is based on hardhat. It contains a different logic than the default hardhat project with regards to deploying and testing the contracts. 
If we want a better deployment interface and a way so that we just hh deploy like we do with hh test and test everything under the test folder we can use a tool called hardhat-deploy. To use this we need to 
```shell
npm install –save-dev hardhat-deploy 
npm install --save-dev  @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers@npm:hardhat-deploy-ethers ethers
```
More info under : https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy. We create a folder called deploy and everything under deploy will get deployed. We create a helper config hardhat config file containing details on the networks which we can add more.  We can use tags and networks e.g. hh deploy –network -ropsten. Finally in case where we have specific contracts that we need to call like chainlink contracts for example that don’t work under a specific testnet or under the localhost, we can create a mock contract and use that instead (so contracts need to contain parametric calls of them in the constructors to be able to play withthem). If we want to load the node directly we can just do hh node and this will also deploy the contracts directly.
